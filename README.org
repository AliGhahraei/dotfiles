* dotfiles
My personal dotfiles (configuration files, [[file:.local/bin/README.md][scripts]], etc.)

** Disclaimer
You probably don't want the exact same system I use, but you could use
this repository to get some new ideas while building your own.
I wouldn't recommend following any instruction, using any config or
running any script without reading and understanding it first. It could
require modifications for your system and you should always read things
from the internet before using them to avoid compromising your computer.

** Installation
If you want to install Arch Linux and configure it, check [[file:.local/bin/arch-install/README.md][arch-install]].
If you just want the files, you can run these commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Cloning the repository
git clone --bare https://github.com/AliGhahraei/dotfiles $HOME/g/dotfiles/repo.git

# Checking out files locally
git --git-dir=$HOME/g/dotfiles/repo.git --work-tree=$HOME checkout
#+END_SRC
