* dotfiles
My personal dotfiles (configuration files, [[file:.local/bin/README.md][scripts]], etc.)

** Disclaimer
You probably don't want the exact same system I use, but you could use
this repository to get some new ideas while building your own.
I wouldn't recommend following any instruction, using any config or
running any script without reading and understanding it first. It could
require modifications for your system and you should always read things
from the internet before using them to avoid compromising your computer.

** Installation
If you want to install Arch Linux and configure it, check [[file:.local/bin/arch-install/README.md][arch-install]].
If you just want the files, run
=git clone --bare https://github.com/AliGhahraei/dotfiles $XDG_DATA_HOME/dotfiles/repo.git=
and optionally =git --git-dir=$XDG_DATA_HOME/dotfiles/repo.git --work-tree=$HOME checkout=
if you don't have the files locally.
